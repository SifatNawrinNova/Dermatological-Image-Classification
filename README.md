# Dermatological-Image-Classification

This project aims to develop an image
classification system to classify skin lesions as either melanoma or nevus using a subset of the 2018 ISIC challenge
dataset. We explore the impact of various techniques, including normalization,
residual connections, data augmentation,
and transfer learning, on the performance
of our models. The ultimate goal is to
contribute to early skin cancer detection
efforts, potentially improving patient outcomes through the application of advanced
ML techniques. After rigorous training
through the dataset, we achieved 0.94 accuracy with the VGG16 pre-trained model.
